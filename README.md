##LuGo Structure Dumper - A Roblox Studio Structure Dumper##

The purpose of this project is to dump updated Roblox structures each studio update.


NOTES:
- I am aware this code does not implement a lot of the checks regular apps should, such as empty optionals, vector ranges, etc.
  This is intentional. The codebase will be updated with new AOBs and/or checks as needed, and since failing on such checks here
  would just "bloat" the codebase without really adding to the telltale sign - being that it needs updating - I felt I wouldn't
  add it here.
